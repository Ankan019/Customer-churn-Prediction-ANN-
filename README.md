# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This is a Deep Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of a bank customer leaving (churning). It uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow and an interactive frontend powered by **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Interactive UI:** Users can input customer details like Credit Score, Geography, Gender, and Balance via sliders and dropdowns.
* **Deep Learning Backend:** Uses a trained ANN model (`model.keras`) for high-accuracy predictions.
* **Dynamic Preprocessing:** Includes real-time scaling and encoding (Label & One-Hot) to process raw user input.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python** (Logic & Data Processing)
* **TensorFlow/Keras** (Neural Network)
* **Streamlit** (Web Framework)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Scaling & Encoding)
* **Pandas/Numpy** (Data Handling)
